My name is SÃ¡vio Guerra Lucena I was born in [Salvador, Bahia, Brazil](https://www.google.com.br/maps/place/Salvador+-+State+of+Bahia/@-12.8808976,-38.5576733,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x716037ca23ca5b3:0x1b9fc7912c226698?hl=en) and I'm currently a Software Engineer for the Brazilian Ministry of Health.

For as long as I can remember I have always been fascinated about technology and the wonders of it. That interest led me to start playing around with a few DOS commands on my first personal computer, and from that time on I never stopped playing with them.

I have earned a degree in Electrical Engineering where I was introduced to a whole new world and was able to explore different perspectives and uses of computer programming.

During that time I have interned at [Accenture](https://www.accenture.com) where I could work my way up to Senior Software Engineer, leading other technologists to accomplish company goals and deliver value to customers.

After working at Accenture for five years and with the rise of mobile development and more complex web applications I got involved with the startup world and decided co-found two technology companies: [Brick](http://www.bricksoftwares.com) - a company that helps other business expand their operations via mobile applications, and Cient - a web based marketplace for online live classes. During this entire entrepreneurial journey I was always in charge of back end development, and server infrastructure.

Feeling the need to face new challenges and explore the latest technologies in the area I joined the Brazilian Ministry of Health.
