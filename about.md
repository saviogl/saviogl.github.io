My name is Sávio Guerra Lucena, I was born in [Salvador, Bahia, Brazil](https://www.google.com.br/maps/place/Salvador+-+State+of+Bahia/@-12.8808976,-38.5576733,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x716037ca23ca5b3:0x1b9fc7912c226698?hl=en) and I'm a Software Engineer at [Comunidade de Práticas](https://atencaobasica.org.br).

For as long as I can remeber I have always been fascinated about technology and the wonders of it. That interest led me to start playing around with a few DOS commands on my first personal computer, and from that time on I never stopped playing with them.

I got into university to earn a degree in Electrical Engineering where I was introduced to a whole new world and was able to explore different facets and uses of computer programming.

During that time I got an internship at [Accenture](https://www.accenture.com) where I could work my way up and by the time I left, 5 years later, I was a Senior Software Engineer and Team Leader.

With the rise of mobile development, web applications and StartUp culture I felt drawn to this new world and wanted to be part of it. To achieve that I co-founded two tech companies: [Brick](http://www.bricksoftwares.com) - a company that helps other companies grow their business through the Internet, and Cient - an online marketplace for online live sessions. In both I was in charge of the back end development, and server infrastructure.

Feeling the need to face new challenges and explore the latest technologies in the area I joined Comunidade de Práticas.
