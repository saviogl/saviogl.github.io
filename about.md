My name is Sávio Guerra Lucena, I was born in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil and I'm a Software Engineer at [Comunidade de Práticas](atencaobasica.org.br).

For as long as I can remeber I have always been fascinated about technology and the wonders of it. That interest led me to start playing around with a few DOS commands on my first personal computer, and from that time on I never stopped playing with them.

I got into university to earn a degree in Electrical Engineering where I was introduced to a whole new wolrd and was able to explore different facets and uses of computer programming.

During my studies I got an internship at [Accenture](https://www.accenture.com) where I could work my way up and by the time I left, 5 years later, I was a Senior Software Engineer and Team Leader.
